# microdroplet-vaginal-cultivation

This repository holds images, MATLAB scripts to process the images into data, and R scripts used to convert the data into figures for the manuscript "Microdroplet-enabled high-throughput cultivation of vaginal bacteria using cervicovaginal fluids" by Jackman et al. (2023).

This only includes scripts for Figure 5 and Figure S5.

The "/image_processing" directory holds images and MATLAB scripts for both figures. "image_process.m" is the MATLAB function called by both "image_analysis.m" and "image_qPCR_comparison.m" for Figure 5 and Figure S5, respectively. The "figures" directory holds the R script used to generate the base figures. Base figures created by these scripts were manually edited in Abode Illustrator for the manuscript.
